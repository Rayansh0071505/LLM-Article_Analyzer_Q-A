       "\"Dear Recruiting Team,\\n\\nWith a strong background in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, along with relevant experience and a dedication to continuous learning, I am confident in my ability to contribute to the success of your organization.\\n\\nI am currently pursuing a B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. I have achieved outstanding academic results throughout my education, including a CGPA of 8.46 in my B.Tech program and scoring 95.4% in Class X and 80.2% in Class XII.\\n\\nMy technical proficiency includes a wide range of skills and knowledge in Deep Learning, Data Analytics, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, Python, SQL Database, TensorFlow, Computer Vision, Data Visualization, Artificial Neural Networks, HTML + CSS, and C++ Language. I have gained practical experience in these areas through my roles as an ML Developer and ML Intern, where I successfully completed projects and collaborated with clients and colleagues.\\n\\nDuring my internship, I had the opportunity to work with emerging technologies like Bloom and gain hands-on experience with computer vision and deep learning. These experiences have strengthened my problem-solving abilities and honed my skills in developing innovative solutions. Furthermore, as a freelancer, I have developed a strong sense of dedication and a commitment to delivering high-quality solutions tailored to meet my clients' unique requirements.\\n\\nI am also actively involved in extracurricular activities. I am a member of Aaruush, where I collaborated with colleagues to manage finances. Additionally, I serve as an Associate in the Next Tech Lab, where I contribute to various projects and stay updated with the latest advancements in the field.\\n\\nIn my recent summer internships, I have worked on diverse projects that have enhanced my practical skills. For example, I developed a data analytics model to predict the sale price of bulldozers, built a multiclassification neural network model for fashion clothing classification, and worked on a computer vision project that converts human pictures into pencil sketches.\\n\\nI have also undertaken projects such as logo placement in webcam screens, dog breed identification using deep learning, heart disease prediction using machine learning, and gym attendance prediction. These projects have not only showcased my technical expertise but also strengthened my ability to work collaboratively in a team environment.\\n\\nI am confident that my strong technical background, practical experience, and dedication to continuous learning make me a suitable candidate for the role of Data Science at your company. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your organization's growth and success.\\n\\nThank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review. I would appreciate the chance to further discuss how my skills and qualifications align with the requirements of the position. I am available for an interview at your convenience.\\n\\nThank you for your time and consideration.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nRayansh Srivastava\""

    "text = \"\"\"Avengers: Endgame is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in Infinity War.\n",
    "\n",
    "The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War  Part 2, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with Infinity War, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, the state of New York, Scotland, and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356–400 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avengers: Endgame premiered in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019, and was released in the United States on April 26, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. The film grossed $2.799 billion worldwide, surpassing Infinity War's entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time from July 2019 until March 2021. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 92nd Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Fifth and sixth Avengers films, titled Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars, respectively, are scheduled to be released in 2026 and 2027.\"\"\"\n"
